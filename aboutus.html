	<h1>EL KABONG Repairs and Salvaged Guitars.
<br> <br><nbsp></nbsp>
The guitars we sell are made using a combination of new and reclaimed parts. Our guitars are never perfect, but they are great value - each guitar is a custom-built instrument. The guitar salvaged parts we sell are all tested to make sure they are fit for purpose.
<nbsp></nbsp>
<br>
Call: 0871234567

If you’re interested in an instrument with a story, EL KABONG Guitars might be worth considering.
<br><nbsp></nbsp>
The bodies we make are made from recycled wood gathered from various sources - old furniture, fence posts, salvaged timber from roof constructions, flooring etc. All constructed and shaped in our rat-infested shed in county Limerick.

We have a selection of new and used guitar bodies in stock, prices starting from €25.00 upwards. We have Telecaster and Stratocaster type bodies, some already painted and some in raw wood.
<br><nbsp></nbsp>
		  
Reused and reshaped, these discarded bits of timber gems have been given a new life. The timber we use is upcycled, repurposed and recycled. Each guitar we make is custom built, each one is unique and one of a kind.
